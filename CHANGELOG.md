# Changelog

All notable changes to Torn Market Edge are documented here.

The project uses semantic-style version numbers for public userscript releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Detect same-item SPA row remounts and re-annotate without requiring a refresh.
- Cancel obsolete queued list-price requests before they consume the API budget.
- Keep the official Torn Item Market API authoritative when visible page listings differ from the API cache.
- Use safer surface-specific price extraction on other Bazaars and travel shops instead of falling back to arbitrary dollar values.
- Protect newer row scans from cleanup performed by superseded async tasks.

### Testing

- Added executable economic regression coverage and hardening guard checks.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- SPA-safe inventory/category detection so tab changes do not require a page refresh.
- Incremental row discovery and annotation.
- Four-request bounded API concurrency.
- Internal 45 requests/minute API ceiling.
- In-flight API request deduplication.
- Fast `limit=20` Item Market snapshots for list-style pages.
- Deep `limit=100` Item Market analysis on detailed Item Market views.
- `cache_timestamp`/`cache_delay` aware caching.
- Persistent compact snapshots with stale-while-revalidate behavior.
- Batched item metadata lookup.
- Early filtering of unsupported equipment.
- Viewport-first request priority.
- Foreground-only DOM processing.
- Surface-specific compact inline UI.
- `comment=market-edge` on Torn API requests for easier API diagnostics.

### Changed

- Inventory analysis now loads multiple item prices in parallel instead of a one-second sequential waterfall.
- List pages render Market Edge information directly in each item row.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Inventory row detection now covers all visible inventory rows rather than only the last matching item.

### Changed

- Inventory intelligence moved onto the native quantity/name line.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Your Bazaar now reads the editable **Price per unit** instead of accidentally interpreting RRP as the current Bazaar price.

### Changed

- Bazaar, Inventory, Auction House and travel-shop output moved from a large bottom panel to compact inline annotations.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Inventory scanning excludes equipped items above the **Your items** inventory section.
